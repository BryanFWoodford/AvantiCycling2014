		<h2 id="bikeability">Bikeability</h2>
		<p>Bikeability is the modern way of teaching your children to ride in traffic. We use modern interactive and realistic teaching methods with highly trained instructors.</p>

		<p>If your children are to use their bikes safely to go to their friends or ride to school then they need experience with real traffic.</p>

		<p>Our courses gently introduce the trainees to traffic in a progressive manner. By the end of the course they will be riding competently in light traffic communicating to drivers and making their own decisions.</p>
